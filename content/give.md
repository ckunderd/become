At Become, our desire is to ensure that God's Kingdom is growing. For us, that means identifying the best leaders we can, investing in them spiritually, organizationally, and financially, and finally launching that leader in a sustainable and healthy way for long-term impact. 

When you give to Become, you invest in two things:

#### Capital investment in new initiatives
More than 50% of the gifts that Become receives goes directly toward funding new initiatives that grow God's Kingdom. Our commitment is to see God's Kingdom grow, and we put every dollar we can toward investment in new leaders and their initiatives. These initiatives need initial funds to launch well, and we love to provide them. 

#### Staff
Become is directed by Cameron Underdown. Cam's salary is paid through the donations of individuals and organizations that believe in the mission and ability of Become. At Become, we do not charge for what we offer to the leaders or mandate a percentage of what is given to the new initiative to come back to Become. Instead, we receive gifts only. We believe that freely we have received from Jesus, and so that in turn, we freely give to others. Many new initiatives could not afford the kind of coaching and assistance we provide, and we love seeing their joy when they realize we are freely offering our gifts. Growing God's Kingdom happens when we stop thinking transactionally and start thinking with a mindset toward stewarding all God has given to us.
