This kingdom exists wherever men and women allow God to rule over their individual lives and become obedient to Godâ€™s ways as revealed through the person of Jesus Christ, who is God in flesh. We work to identify leaders with a kingdom-growing vision, invest in the leader spiritually, organizationally, and financially, and work with the leader to launch initiatives that help the Kingdom of God grow it's influence throughout creation. Our hope is to work with as many people as we can who are willing to ask who God is asking him or her to become, and see the Kingdom of God grow as a result."
